## Introduction
This project is a **Quiz Program** developed in C++. It showcases various C++ features, including inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation, all implemented within a single file, `quiz.cpp`. The program allows users to take quizzes on different topics and keeps track of their scores.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The program is designed using classes and inheritance to manage different aspects of the quiz.
- **Polymorphism**: The program supports various question types, handled polymorphically within the same framework.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Efficient memory handling using pointers and dynamic arrays.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks user scores and provides feedback upon quiz completion.
- **File I/O**: The program can save and load quiz data and results from files.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Used for data structures like vectors and various algorithms.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing the project.
